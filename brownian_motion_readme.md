## Background

### What is Brownian Motion?

Brownian motion is the random, erratic movement of microscopic particles suspended in a fluid (liquid or gas). This phenomenon was first observed by botanist Robert Brown in 1827 when he noticed pollen grains moving randomly in water under a microscope.

**Physical Origin:**
- Particles are constantly bombarded by molecules of the surrounding fluid
- Each collision imparts a tiny momentum change
- These collisions occur from all directions randomly
- The net effect is a "random walk" trajectory

**Historical Significance:**
- Provided early evidence for the atomic nature of matter
- Albert Einstein's 1905 mathematical theory of Brownian motion helped prove atoms exist
- Foundation for understanding diffusion, molecular transport, and stochastic processes

**Modern Applications:**
- Drug delivery in biological systems
- Particle tracking in cells
- Financial modeling (stock price movements)
- Polymer physics
- Colloidal suspension studies

## Theory

### Random Walk Model

Brownian motion can be modeled as a **random walk**:
- At each time step, the particle moves a random distance in a random direction
- The displacement has no memory of previous steps (Markov process)
- All directions are equally probable (isotropic)

### Mean Square Displacement (MSD)

The **Mean Square Displacement** is the average of the squared distance from the starting position:

```
MSD(t) = ⟨r²(t)⟩ = ⟨[x(t) - x(0)]² + [y(t) - y(0)]²⟩
```

For our simulation starting at the origin (x₀ = 0, y₀ = 0):

```
MSD(t) = ⟨x²(t) + y²(t)⟩
```

### Einstein's Diffusion Equation

Einstein showed that for Brownian motion in **2D**, the MSD grows linearly with time:

```
⟨r²(t)⟩ = 4Dt
```

Where:
- **D** = Diffusion coefficient (units: length²/time, e.g., μm²/s)
- **t** = Time elapsed
- **4** = Dimensionality factor (2D: factor is 4, 3D: factor is 6, 1D: factor is 2)

The diffusion coefficient depends on:
- **Temperature (T)**: Higher temperature → faster motion
- **Particle size (r)**: Larger particles → slower motion  
- **Fluid viscosity (η)**: More viscous fluid → slower motion

Einstein-Stokes relation: **D = kᵦT/(6πηr)**

### Why MSD Instead of Mean Displacement?

The **mean displacement** ⟨r(t)⟩ = 0 because the particle moves randomly in all directions (positive and negative displacements cancel out). The **MSD** captures the spread of the distribution and quantifies how far the particle diffuses.

## Simulation Method

### Algorithm Overview

Our simulation implements a **discrete random walk** approximation:

1. **Initialize**: Start particle at origin (0, 0)

2. **Time Loop**: For each time step:
   - Generate random angle θ uniformly from [0, 2π]
   - Calculate step: Δx = σ·cos(θ), Δy = σ·sin(θ)
   - Update position: x(t) = x(t-1) + Δx, y(t) = y(t-1) + Δy
   
3. **Calculate MSD**: For each time point, compute r²(t) = x²(t) + y²(t)

4. **Compare**: Plot simulated MSD against theoretical prediction

### Step Size Calculation

The step size σ (step_size in code) is derived from the diffusion coefficient:

For 2D Brownian motion, the variance of displacement in time Δt is:
```
⟨Δr²⟩ = 4D·Δt
```

Therefore, the standard deviation (step size) is:
```
σ = √(4D·Δt)
```

This ensures our discrete random walk has the correct diffusion properties.

### Isotropy (Direction Independence)

By choosing a random angle θ uniformly from [0, 2π]:
- All directions are equally likely
- No preferred direction of motion
- Models true Brownian motion in an isotropic medium

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
- MATLAB (any recent version, R2016a or later recommended)
- No additional toolboxes required

### Running the Simulation

1. **Save the code** as `brownian_motion_2d.m`

2. **Open MATLAB** and navigate to the directory containing the file

3. **Run the script**:
   ```matlab
   brownian_motion_2d
   ```
   Or click the "Run" button in MATLAB editor

4. **View results**:
   - Figure window with 3 plots will appear
   - Console output shows numerical results

### Modifying Parameters

You can easily modify the simulation by changing parameters at the top of the code:

```matlab
n_steps = 2000;     % Try 5000 for longer simulation
dt = 0.01;          % Try 0.001 for finer time resolution  
D = 1.0;            % Try 0.5 or 2.0 for different diffusion rates
```

**Note**: After changing parameters, save and re-run the script.

## Understanding the Results

### Plot 1: Trajectory (X vs Y)

**What it shows:**
- The actual path taken by the particle in 2D space
- Green circle: Starting position (origin)
- Red square: Final position
- Blue line: Complete trajectory

**What to look for:**
- Random, irregular path (not smooth)
- No preferred direction
- The particle may wander far from origin
- Each run produces a different trajectory

**Physical Interpretation:**
- Mimics how a real microscopic particle would move
- The "jittery" path reflects molecular collisions

### Plot 2: Position Components vs Time

**What it shows:**
- X-position (blue) and Y-position (red) as functions of time
- How far the particle has moved in each direction

**What to look for:**
- Both curves fluctuate randomly
- No systematic drift up or down (average is zero)
- X and Y are independent (uncorrelated)
- Variance increases with time

**Physical Interpretation:**
- Shows the random nature of each coordinate
- Demonstrates that displacement in X doesn't affect Y

### Plot 3: MSD vs Time

**What it shows:**
- Blue solid line: Simulated MSD from our particle
- Red dashed line: Theoretical prediction (MSD = 4Dt)

**What to look for:**
- MSD increases over time (particle spreads out)
- Simulated curve fluctuates around theoretical line
- **Important**: Single particle MSD is noisy!
- General trend should follow linear growth

**Why the Noise?**
- Single particle = one realization of random process
- Like flipping a coin 10 times might give 7 heads instead of expected 5
- Averaging many particles would smooth the curve
- The noise is physically realistic!

**Physical Interpretation:**
- Linear growth confirms diffusive behavior
- Slope = 4D (can estimate diffusion coefficient)
- Steeper slope = faster diffusion

## Parameters Explained

### Number of Steps (n_steps)

**Default**: 2000

**Effect:**
- More steps = longer simulation time
- More steps = better statistics for MSD
- Longer trajectories show diffusive behavior more clearly

**Recommendations:**
- Minimum: 500 steps
- For smoother MSD: 5000-10000 steps
- Very large values (>50000) may slow down plotting

### Time Step (dt)

**Default**: 0.01 seconds

**Effect:**
- Smaller dt = finer time resolution
- Must be small enough that particle moves only a small distance per step
- Total time = n_steps × dt

**Recommendations:**
- Typical range: 0.001 to 0.1 seconds
- Should be much smaller than timescale of interest
- If step_size becomes too large, reduce dt

### Diffusion Coefficient (D)

**Default**: 1.0 μm²/s

**Effect:**
- Larger D = faster diffusion = larger displacements
- Controls how quickly particle spreads out
- Affects step_size directly

**Physical Context:**
- Small molecule in water: ~1000 μm²/s
- Protein in water: ~50 μm²/s
- Virus particle: ~5 μm²/s
- 1 μm bead in water: ~0.4 μm²/s

**Recommendations:**
- Try D = 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 to see effect on trajectories
- Adjust D to match your system of interest

## Expected Output

### Console Output Example

```
Simulating 2D Brownian motion...

=== Simulation Results ===
Number of steps: 2000
Time step: 0.0100 s
Total simulation time: 20.00 s
Diffusion coefficient: 1.000 μm²/s

Final position: (3.472, -5.891) μm
Final distance from origin: 6.846 μm
Final MSD: 46.868 μm²
Theoretical MSD at final time: 80.000 μm²

=== Important Note ===
For a SINGLE particle, the MSD curve will be noisy and may deviate
significantly from the theoretical prediction. This is expected!
Run the simulation multiple times to see different trajectories.
For smoother MSD curves, use ensemble averaging with multiple particles.
```

### Interpretation

- **Final position**: Where the particle ended up (random each run)
- **Final distance**: How far from origin (√(x² + y²))
- **Final MSD**: The actual squared distance at end time
- **Theoretical MSD**: What Einstein's equation predicts (4Dt)

**Note**: These values change every time you run the simulation due to randomness!

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: MSD doesn't match theory well

**Cause**: Single particle trajectories are inherently noisy

**Solutions:**
- This is expected! Run simulation multiple times
- Use more steps (n_steps = 5000 or more)
- For smoother curves, average multiple independent runs
- Or use ensemble averaging (multiple particles)

### Issue: Particle moves too fast or too slow

**Solution**: Adjust diffusion coefficient D
- Decrease D for slower diffusion
- Increase D for faster diffusion

### Issue: Plots are too crowded or hard to read

**Solutions:**
- Reduce n_steps for simpler trajectories
- Adjust figure size in code
- Zoom in on specific regions of plots

### Issue: Code runs slowly

**Solutions:**
- Reduce n_steps (try 1000 or 500)
- Close other figures before running
- Ensure MATLAB has sufficient memory

### Issue: Error messages

**Common errors:**
- "Index exceeds array dimensions": Check n_steps is positive integer
- "Out of memory": Reduce n_steps
- Make sure all parameters are defined before simulation loop
